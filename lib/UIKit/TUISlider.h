// A TUISlider is a visual control used to select a single value
// from a continuous range of values. Sliders are always displayed as
// horizontal or vertical bars. An indicator, or thumb, notes the current
// value of the slider and can be moved by the user to change the setting.
@interface TUISlider : TUIControl
// If you change the value of this property, and the current value of
// the receiver is below the new minimum, the current value is adjusted
// to match the new minimum value automatically.
// The default value of this property is 0.0.
@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat minimumValue;

// If you change the value of this property, and the current value of
// the receiver is above the new maximum, the current value is adjusted
// to match the new maximum value automatically.
// The default value of this property is 1.0.
@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat maximumValue;

// Setting this property causes the receiver to redraw itself using
// the new value. If you try to set a value that is below the minimum
// or above the maximum value, the minimum or maximum value is set
// instead. The default value of this property is 0.0.
@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat value;

// The thickness of the slider knob. The thickness is defined to be the
// extent of the knob along the long dimension of the bar. In a vertical
// slider, then, a knob’s thickness is its height; in a horizontal slider,
// a knob’s thickness is its width. The default value of this property is 0.0.

// the minimum and maximum values are included.

// Draw the tick marks on the alternate side of the slider - for a
// vertical slider, this draws the ticks on the top, and for a horizontal
// slider, this draws the ticks on the right side instead of left.
// This method has no effect if no tick marks have been assigned (that
// is, numberOfTickMarks returns 0).
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL drawTickMarksOnAlternateSide;

// Set YES if the slider's values should be fixed to the values represented
// by its tick marks; otherwise NO. For example, if a slider has a minimum
// value of 0, a maximum value of 100, and five markers, the allowable
// values are 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100. When users move the slider’s knob, it
// jumps to the tick mark nearest the cursor when the mouse button is released.
// This method has no effect if the slider has no tick marks.

// To customize the drawing of the slider, override both the drawTrack and
// drawKnob blocks, or subclass and override the methods in the new class.
